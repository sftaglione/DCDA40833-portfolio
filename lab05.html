<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
For this lab, I explored what it actually means to use AI as a coding collaborator instead of just copying and pasting code without understanding it. The focus wasn’t just on building something new, but on making sure I could fully read, explain, and modify any code I decided to include in my portfolio. One of the biggest rules for this assignment was that if I can’t explain what a line of code does, I shouldn’t be using it. That forced me to slow down and really think through each step instead of just trusting the output.
</p>

<p>
To apply that, I completed two experiments. First, I added a dark mode feature to my portfolio to enhance the user experience and practice integrating AI-generated JavaScript into an existing site. Second, I debugged a real issue in my navigation where a small file-name mistake caused a broken link. Both experiments required me to review the code line-by-line, test it, and make small adjustments so it actually worked within my own structure. Overall, this lab helped me see AI less as a shortcut and more as a tool that still requires active understanding and decision-making.

<h2>Experiment A: Portfolio Enhancement (Dark Mode)</h2>

<p>
I used AI to help generate the initial structure for a dark mode toggle.
My goal was simple: when a user clicks a button in the navigation bar, the site switches to darker colors.
I reviewed every line before adding it to my site and simplified parts so it matched my existing CSS structure.
</p>

<h3>Key Code Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>
// This grabs the dark mode button from the page
const darkBtn = document.getElementById("darkModeBtn");

// When the button is clicked, this function runs
darkBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {

    // This toggles the "dark-mode" class on the body
    // If it's there, it removes it. If it's not, it adds it.
    document.body.classList.toggle("dark-mode");

});
</code></pre>

<p>
Basically, this works by waiting for a click on the button. When it’s clicked, it adds or removes a class called “dark-mode” on the body element. The CSS handles the rest by changing the background and text colors whenever that class is active.
</p>

<h2>Experiment C: Debugging With AI</h2>

<p>
While reviewing my portfolio, I noticed my Lab 5 card on the home page did not match the actual filename of my lab page.
The card linked to "lab5.html" but my file is named "lab05.html."
This caused a broken navigation path.
</p>

<h3>What Was Wrong</h3>

<p>
Originally, my Lab 05 card linked to:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="Lab5.html"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
But my actual file name is:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="Lab05.html"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
That small difference (the missing 0) caused the navigation to break.
</p>

<p>
The issue was that my link used <code>Lab5.html</code> instead of <code>Lab05.html</code>.
That single missing zero caused the broken path.
</p>

<p>
I identified the issue first, then used AI to confirm the fix.
This experiment showed me that debugging is often about checking simple structural errors like file names and paths.
AI was helpful in confirming my reasoning, but I still had to understand the root cause.

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>For this lab, I used Chat GPT as a coding collaborator rather than just a code generator. The main feature the AI helped me build was a dark mode toggle for my portfolio. It generated JavaScript that selects a button, listens for a click event, and then toggles a “dark-mode” class on the body element. I also used AI to help confirm a debugging issue when I realized one of my navigation links was broken because of a file naming mismatch. In both cases, the AI provided a starting point, but I had to fully understand what it was doing before keeping any of it.</p>

<p>The dark mode feature works by attaching an event listener to a button. When the button is clicked, it uses classList.toggle() to add or remove the “dark-mode” class from the body. The CSS I wrote defines different background and text colors when that class is active. I understand the overall logic and flow of this feature, even if I couldn’t have written it perfectly from memory on the first try. I would place myself in the “I understand the logic” category on the spectrum. I know what each line is doing and why it’s necessary, but I still rely on syntax reminders sometimes. The debugging experiment felt more straightforward because it was a structural issue. The AI confirmed that my broken link was due to using “Lab5.html” instead of “Lab05.html.” That showed me how small details can cause larger functional problems.</p>

<p>AI was most helpful in accelerating the initial setup. Instead of spending time trying to remember exact syntax for event listeners, I could focus on understanding how the pieces worked together. However, it was also problematic when it generated slightly more complex solutions than necessary. I had to simplify parts of the code so it matched my existing structure and skill level. This made me realize that my role in an AI-assisted workflow is still critical. I am responsible for reviewing, testing, simplifying, and making sure the code aligns with my design and goals. AI can generate options, but it cannot judge whether they truly fit my project.</p>

<p>In terms of learning trade-offs, vibe coding can help when it supports understanding, but it can hurt if it replaces it. If I blindly copy code, I miss the learning process. If I use AI to explore patterns and then break them down line-by-line, it becomes a learning tool. Moving forward, I plan to use AI for drafts, troubleshooting, and clarification, but I will not submit anything I cannot explain in my own words. This lab helped me see that responsible AI use is less about avoiding it and more about maintaining agency and understanding while using it.</p>

<h2>Self-Assessment</h2>

<p>After completing this lab, I took time to honestly evaluate my work. I can clearly separate what I understand from what I still rely on AI to help with. I understand the logic of the dark mode feature and how the class toggle works, but I still occasionally need syntax reminders for event listeners and JavaScript structure. I’m comfortable explaining what the code does and why it works, even if I couldn’t rewrite it perfectly from memory.</p>

<p>I did not accept the AI’s output blindly. I simplified parts of the generated code so it matched my current skill level and the structure of my site. The debugging experiment also forced me to identify the issue myself before using AI to confirm it. That helped reinforce that AI should support my reasoning, not replace it.</p>

<p>I also believe I chose experiments that challenged me without being unrealistic. Adding a new feature required me to integrate JavaScript into an existing site, which pushed me beyond static HTML and CSS. At the same time, I avoided overly advanced solutions that I would not be able to defend. Most importantly, this reflection reflects my actual thinking. I am not claiming to fully “master” anything. Instead, I am learning how to use AI responsibly while still maintaining ownership of my work and growth as a programmer.</p>
