<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
For this lab, I explored what it actually means to use AI as a coding collaborator instead of just copying and pasting code without understanding it. The focus wasn’t just on building something new, but on making sure I could fully read, explain, and modify any code I decided to include in my portfolio. One of the biggest rules for this assignment was that if I can’t explain what a line of code does, I shouldn’t be using it. That forced me to slow down and really think through each step instead of just trusting the output.
</p>

<p>
To follow the directions, I completed two experiments. For Experiment A, I added a dark mode toggle feature to my portfolio. For Experiment C, I debugged a real issue in my navigation where a small file-name mistake caused a broken link. Both experiments made me review code line-by-line, test it on my site, and adjust things so it actually worked with my existing structure.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Experiment A: Portfolio Enhancement (Dark Mode)</h2>

<p>
For this experiment, I used AI to help generate the starter code for a dark mode toggle. My goal was simple: add a button in my navigation that switches the site into a darker theme. I didn’t just paste the first thing I got back — I checked the logic, tested it, and adjusted styling so it matched the look of my portfolio.
</p>

<h3>Key Code Snippet</h3>

 <pre><code>// This grabs the dark mode button from the page
const darkBtn = document.getElementById("darkModeBtn");

// When the button is clicked, this function runs
darkBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {

    // This toggles the "dark-mode" class on the body
    // If it's there, it removes it. If it's not, it adds it.
    document.body.classList.toggle("dark-mode");

});
</code></pre>

<p>
Basically, this works by listening for a click on the button. When it’s clicked, it turns a styling label called dark-mode on or off for the whole page. The CSS does the rest by changing background and text colors whenever that label is active.
</p>

<h2>Experiment C: Debugging With AI</h2>

<p>
While reviewing my portfolio, I noticed my Lab 5 card on the home page wasn’t opening the lab page correctly on GitHub Pages. I checked the link and realized the card was pointing to lab5.html, but my actual file name is lab05.html. That one missing zero caused the navigation to break.
</p>

<h3>What Was Wrong</h3>

<p>
The homepage link originally pointed to:
</p>

 <pre><code>&lt;a href="lab5.html"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
But my actual file name is:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="lab05.html"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
That small difference (the missing 0) caused the navigation to break.
</p>

<p>
I identified the issue first, then used AI to confirm the fix. This experiment honestly reminded me that debugging is sometimes about checking small details like file names and paths. AI helped confirm what I was thinking, but I still had to understand why the error happened.
</p>

            <h2>AI Prompts + AI Output (Documentation)</h2>

            <p>
                Below are examples of prompts I used and the type of output AI generated. I used these as a starting point, then tested and adjusted the code so it fit my portfolio.
            </p>

            <h3>Experiment A Prompt</h3>
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Help me add a beginner-friendly dark mode toggle to my portfolio site. I want a button in the navigation bar. When clicked, it should toggle dark mode by adding/removing a class on the body. Please give me the HTML button, the JavaScript, and the CSS.</p>

            <h3>Experiment A Output Example (JavaScript)</h3>
            <pre><code>const darkBtn = document.getElementById("darkModeBtn");

darkBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
});</code></pre>

            <h3>Experiment C Prompt</h3>
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> My Lab 5 card links to lab5.html, but my file is named lab05.html. GitHub Pages shows a broken page. What should I change?</p>

            <h3>Experiment C Output Example (Before → After)</h3>
            <pre><code><!-- Before -->
&lt;a href="lab5.html"&gt;

<!-- After -->
&lt;a href="lab05.html"&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
For this lab, I used ChatGPT as a coding collaborator rather than just a code generator. The main feature the AI helped me build was a dark mode toggle for my portfolio. It generated JavaScript that selects a button, listens for a click event, and toggles a “dark-mode” styling label on the body element. I also used AI to confirm a debugging issue when I realized one of my navigation links was broken because of a file naming mismatch. In both cases, the AI gave me a starting point, but I still had to understand what it was doing before keeping it.
</p>

<p>
The dark mode feature works by attaching an event listener to the button. When clicked, it runs a function that uses classList.toggle() to add or remove “dark-mode” from the body element. The CSS changes the background and text colors when that mode is active. I understand the overall logic of how this works and could explain it to someone at my same skill level, even though I might still need help remembering exact syntax if I were doing it from scratch. I would place myself in the “I understand the logic” category on the understanding spectrum. The debugging experiment felt more straightforward because it was a structural issue. The link was broken because my homepage used lab5.html while my actual file was lab05.html. That reminded me how small details can completely break navigation.
</p>

<p>
AI was most helpful in speeding up the starting point. Instead of spending a lot of time remembering syntax, I could focus on reading and understanding how the parts worked together. At the same time, AI can be problematic because it sometimes generates extra code or more complicated solutions than necessary. I had to simplify and adjust the output so it matched my site and didn’t create new issues. This lab made it clear that my role in an AI-assisted workflow is still the most important part. I’m responsible for reviewing, testing, and making final decisions. AI can generate options, but it can’t replace judgment or ownership.
</p>

<p>
In terms of learning trade-offs, vibe coding helps when it supports learning and slows you down enough to understand what’s happening. It hurts when it becomes a shortcut that replaces the learning process. Going forward, I’ll use AI for drafts, troubleshooting, and clarification, but I won’t submit code I can’t explain in my own words. This lab helped me see that responsible AI use is really about keeping agency and understanding while still using the tool.

<h2>Self-Assessment</h2>

<p>After completing this lab, I took time to honestly evaluate my work. I can clearly separate what I understand from what I still rely on AI to help with. I understand the logic of the dark mode feature and how the class toggle works, but I still occasionally need syntax reminders for event listeners and JavaScript structure. I’m comfortable explaining what the code does and why it works, even if I couldn’t rewrite it perfectly from memory. I did not accept the AI’s output blindly. I simplified parts of the generated code so it matched my current skill level and the structure of my site. The debugging experiment also forced me to identify the issue myself before using AI to confirm it. That helped reinforce that AI should support my reasoning, not replace it.</p>

<p>I also believe I chose experiments that challenged me without being unrealistic. Adding a new feature required me to integrate JavaScript into an existing site, which pushed me beyond static HTML and CSS. At the same time, I avoided overly advanced solutions that I would not be able to defend. Most importantly, this reflection reflects my actual thinking. I am not claiming to fully “master” anything. Instead, I am learning how to use AI responsibly while still maintaining ownership of my work and growth as a programmer.</p>

            <h2>My Guidelines for Using AI in Coding</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>I will use AI for initial drafts, syntax reminders, and troubleshooting when I’m stuck.</li>
                <li>I will not submit code I can’t explain in my own words.</li>
                <li>If the code feels too complex for my current skill level, I will simplify it before keeping it.</li>
                <li>I will review AI-generated code line-by-line instead of assuming it’s correct.</li>
                <li>I will test changes across my site before committing them, especially navigation and styling.</li>
                <li>I will be transparent about what AI contributed vs. what I changed or wrote myself.</li>
            </ul>
