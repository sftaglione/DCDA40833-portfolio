            <p>Hi, my name is Sophia Taglione, and I am a Junior at Texas Christian University. I’m majoring in Strategic Communication and minoring in Digital Culture and Data Analytics. I’ve always been interested in how people connect, especially through media and technology, and my coursework has allowed me to blend creativity with strategy in meaningful ways. I come from a big Italian family of six with three sisters, which has shaped my appreciation for teamwork, energy, and strong relationships. My family also has a ranch, where spending time riding horses and helping out has taught me responsibility and a strong work ethic.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I’m very involved in my sorority, Delta Gamma, where I’ve had leadership roles like Social Media Chair and Panhellenic Delegate. Being active on campus has allowed me to build friendships, gain leadership experience, and balance my academic life with my social life. I also enjoy traveling, fashion, and finding new creative outlets whether it’s through social media, design projects, or event planning. Looking ahead, I hope to use what I’m learning at TCU to build a career in advertising, PR, or digital media. My goal is to help brands connect with people in authentic ways while staying creative and culturally aware. I am excited to keep learning, growing, and finding opportunities that let me combine my passions with my career goals.</p>
