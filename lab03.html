    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this lab, I critically evaluate a real-world data visualization using Edward Tufte’s principles about how evidence should be presented. Instead of just describing what the graphic shows, I look at how well it actually communicates its message, how complete the information is, and whether the conclusions feel fully supported. By focusing on concepts like information resolution, effects without causes, and the “rage to conclude,” this critique pushes beyond surface-level design and looks at the strength of the argument itself. The goal is to better understand how visuals shape the way we interpret data and how to create visualizations that are not just eye-catching, but responsible and clear.

        <h2>Reflection & Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
        <p>
            This visualization clearly compares how much energy is retained when different fuel sources are converted into electricity, showing wind as the most efficient and coal and oil as the least. The large bubble sizes and bold percentages immediately draw attention and make the ranking easy to understand. However, when looking at information resolution, the graphic feels somewhat limited. The visualization also does not clearly define the units behind these percentages. It is unclear whether the values represent energy return on investment, efficiency ratios, or another measurement. Without clearly labeled units or a defined calculation method, viewers cannot verify the math or fully understand what the percentages actually represent. Even with the original source credited, the graphic does not include enough methodological detail (definitions, assumptions, or calculation notes) to let a viewer connect the claim to the underlying source material. Even when following the linked source, the visualization still lacks detailed explanation of how these values were calculated, reinforcing the gap between the visual claim and the underlying data. It gives us the percentages, but it does not explain how those numbers were calculated, what time period they represent, or whether they apply globally or to a specific region. It also mentions factoring in the energy required to fix and mitigate emissions, but it does not explain how that was measured. Because of this, viewers see the final results without much background on how the data was produced. As Tufte argues, high-resolution displays of evidence require enough context, including clearly defined units and methods, to truly support interpretation, and that level of detail is not fully present here.
        </p>

        <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
        <p>
            The infographic focuses heavily on the final outcomes of energy efficiency comparisons but does not explain why those differences exist. For example, wind is shown retaining 1164% energy input, yet the visualization does not explain what processes, assumptions, or calculations allow wind to appear so much more efficient than fossil fuels. There is no discussion of technological processes, infrastructure demands, or environmental trade-offs that might influence these results. Coal and oil are presented as the least efficient, but the mechanical or economic reasons behind their lower numbers are not explored. By showing only the results, the graphic simplifies a very complex energy system into a single percentage comparison. While this makes the message clear and impactful, it leaves out important context that would help viewers understand the full picture.
        </p>

        <h3>Rage to Conclude</h3>
        <p>
            The headline, “Wind is the Most Efficient Source of Energy, Coal and Oil are the Least,” makes a strong and confident claim right away. The wording sounds definitive and leaves little room for qualification. Although the percentages support this statement within the scope of retained energy input, the visualization does not address other important factors such as storage challenges, reliability, geographic limitations, or cost. Because of this, viewers might interpret the graphic as proving overall energy superiority rather than just efficiency in one specific category. This reflects what Tufte calls a “rage to conclude,” where the visual pushes toward a clear takeaway without fully acknowledging the complexity behind the data.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Overall, the visualization is visually engaging and easy to understand at first glance. The use of color, scale, and layout makes the comparison between energy sources immediately clear. However, when evaluated through Tufte’s framework, it prioritizes impact and simplicity over deeper context. The lack of explanation behind the data, including missing units and unclear measurement methods, limits its information resolution, while the strong headline encourages a broad conclusion that extends beyond what is fully explained in the graphic. While it works well as a high-level summary, adding more context and explanation would make the argument stronger and more balanced.
