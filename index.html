I enjoy exploring how design, technology, and communication work together to create meaningful messages. Outside of academics, I value creativity, collaboration, and leadership, all of which influence the way I approach my work.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> Through this course, I hope to develop stronger technical skills in data analysis, visualization, and web development. I also want to learn how to critically evaluate digital tools and platforms while building a portfolio that reflects both my creativity and growth as a data-informed communicator.</p>

            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> In this lab, I learned how to set up a GitHub repository, edit files using Visual Studio Code, and deploy a live website using GitHub Pages. I also gained a better understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to structure and style a portfolio.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> One challenge I faced was troubleshooting issues with file organization and CSS styling, especially when adjusting image size and layout. I worked through this by carefully reviewing the instructions, testing changes step by step, and using feedback to improve my site.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> This lab helped me become more comfortable working with unfamiliar tools and showed me how digital projects are built iteratively rather than all at once.</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> As the semester continues, I plan to expand this portfolio with data visualizations, interactive projects, and deeper reflections on digital culture and analytics.</p>
