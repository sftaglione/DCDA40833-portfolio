            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> Hi, my name is Sophia Taglione, and I am a Junior at Texas Christian University. I’m majoring in Strategic Communication and minoring in Digital Culture and Data Analytics. I am passionate about understanding how people communicate and connect in digital spaces. One interesting fact about me is that I enjoy balancing creative and analytical work, which has helped shape my academic and professional interests.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I am especially interested in social media strategy, digital culture, and how data influences storytelling and audience engagement. I enjoy exploring how design, technology, and communication work together to create meaningful messages. Outside of academics, I value creativity, collaboration, and leadership, all of which influence the way I approach my work.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> Through this course, I hope to develop stronger technical skills in data analysis, visualization, and web development. I also want to learn how to critically evaluate digital tools and platforms while building a portfolio that reflects both my creativity and growth as a data-informed communicator.</p>

            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
                
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> In this lab, I learned how to critically analyze a data visualization instead of just looking at it and accepting it as true. Using Tufte’s framework made me realize how much context, detail, and explanation matter when presenting data. I also learned how strong headlines and design choices can influence how people interpret information.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> One challenge I faced was moving beyond simply describing the infographic and actually analyzing it. At first, I kept explaining what I saw instead of evaluating how effective it was. I worked through this by re-reading the framework and asking myself deeper questions about what was missing and what assumptions the graphic might be encouraging.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> This lab helped me think more critically about visuals I see online, especially when they make bold claims. I now pay more attention to where data comes from, what context is missing, and whether conclusions are fully supported. It made me more aware of how design and argument connect.</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> As the semester continues, I want to keep improving my ability to balance design and accuracy in my own work. I also want to get more comfortable questioning data instead of just accepting it at face value.</p>
