    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This lab explores and evaluates AI tools using a structured framework focused on
        capabilities, appropriate use, ethics, and transparency. The goal is to develop
        a critical approach to AI tools rather than simply using them for productivity.

    <h2>Tool Evaluated: ChatGPT</h2>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
    <p>
        ChatGPT demonstrated strong summarization capabilities when asked to condense an
        academic-style article into five concise bullet points. The output clearly identified
        major themes related to social media use, academic performance, and mental health.

    <h3>Limitations & Appropriate Use</h3>
    <p>
        When prompted to write a 300-word college reflection on digital culture and AI ethics,
        ChatGPT produced a well-structured and fluent response. However, the reflection remained
        fairly general and lacked personal voice and lived experience. This highlights that
        while ChatGPT can assist with brainstorming or outlining, it should not replace original
        student reflection or critical thinking.
    </p>

    <h3>Transparency & Fact-Checking</h3>
    <p>
        When asked to provide peer-reviewed sources on AI bias, ChatGPT generated a list of
        widely cited academic works. While many sources were legitimate, the response required
        verification to ensure accuracy and proper citation. This reinforces the importance
        of independently fact-checking AI-generated references before using them in academic work.

<section>
    <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>
        Ethical concerns emerged throughout this evaluation, particularly around bias,
        transparency, and authorship. ChatGPT does not disclose its training data in detail,
        making it difficult to fully assess whose perspectives are represented or excluded.
        Additionally, its ability to generate polished academic-style writing raises questions
        about authorship, originality, and appropriate attribution in educational settings.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Reflection & Looking Forward</h3>
    <p>
        This evaluation reinforced the idea that AI tools are not neutral and must be used
        thoughtfully. Moving forward, I see ChatGPT as a supportive tool for brainstorming,
        outlining, and exploring ideas, but not as a replacement for human judgment or original
        work. Developing a structured evaluation framework will help me critically assess new
        AI tools as they continue to evolve.

    <h3>Tool Evaluated: Canva Magic Write</h3>
    <p>
        Canva’s Magic Write tool was evaluated to understand its capabilities in generating
        structured written content. When prompted to create an outline on AI ethics, the tool
        produced a clearly organized, presentation-style response that followed a logical flow
        across key ethical themes.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the outputs remained high-level and generic, offering surface-level explanations
        without citations, concrete examples, or critical depth. While Magic Write is useful for
        brainstorming or organizing ideas, it is not well-suited for producing polished academic
        analysis without significant human revision.
